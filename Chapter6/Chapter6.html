						<p><b>Dead Sea in Israel</b>
The dark blue waters of the Dead Sea touch the borders of both Jordan and Israel. Actually a lake despite its name, the Dead Sea sits at the lowest land elevation on Earth—over 430 meters below sea level. With a salt concentration of around 31 percent—almost 10 times saltier than the ocean —the Dead Sea is so thick, nothing can sink into it, and everyone who walks into it will naturally float.

While the coastline around the lake has become a flourishing spa and resort destination, there is also a large influx of religious tourism in the area. Jericho, the city where Jesus is said to have healed blind beggars, is located just minutes northwest of the Dead Sea—and a number of other cities, including the legendary Sodom and Gomorra, as well as Zoar and Admah, are also located in this area. The area boasts some of the oldest inhabited cities in the world.

While the lake is too salty to support aquatic life, there are plenty of animals that call the surrounding desert home—and hikers will run into anything from hares to foxes and leopards when exploring the nature reserves around the Dead Sea.</p>

						<p><b>Kamala Beach, Phuket</b>
Thailand's biggest island is also a magnet for visitors—and for good reason. Phuket boasts some of the best beaches in the country, with clean, soft, rolling sands and turquoise waters as far as the eye can see.

Kata, Hat Karon, and Kamala beaches see a lot of tourists during the high season (November to February) but remain sleepy little villages once the rains arrive. Beautiful coral reefs line up the coastline, offering amazing opportunities for snorkeling and diving but also sea kayaking and island hopping.

In between hours of lying under the sun, visitors can head to the white and gold Wat Chalong, the largest and most important Buddhist temple on the island, or climb up a hill to reach the Big Buddha—a 45-meter-tall statue covered with Burmese marble.

The island is also home to a number of unique festivals. The Ghost Festival during the 7th Chinese lunar month is dedicated to ancestor worship, and it entails releasing lanterns into the ocean to help guide lost souls—a sight to behold.

The Vegetarian Festival during the 9th Chinese lunar month is another stunning celebration—which, despite the name, is not so much about food but about purification and putting the body through extreme tests, such as fire walking and hanging from hooks.</p>

						<p><b>Forbidden City</b>
One of the most populous cities in the world, Beijing is also one of the oldest. You can get a peek into that history by walking the hutongs of Beijing, the narrow alleyways lined up with traditional homes and courtyards.

China's capital is home to seven UNESCO World Heritage Sites, including the Imperial Summer Palace and its gardens, the oldest canal in the world, and the Forbidden City—a palace complex that served as the home of China's emperors for 500 years starting in the 1420s. The Forbidden City—made up of almost 1,000 different buildings—is one of Beijing's most impressive tourist attractions.

The city also offers visitors many unique-looking pagodas and temples, including the 12th-century, eight-sided Tianning Temple, as well as almost 150 museums and galleries.

The Military Museum of the Chinese People's Revolution and the National Art Museum of China have massive collections and are well worth a visit.

Several sections of the Great Wall can also be found within Beijing, including the wall's most visited site, the 80-kilometer-long Badaling section.</p>

						<p><b>The Acropolis of Athens with the Parthenon Temple on top of the hill at sunset</b>
Watching over Athens from atop a rocky outcrop, the ancient citadel is one of Greece's most famous tourist destinations.

The Acropolis' most famous buildings were all constructed in the fifth century BC under the watchful eye of statesman and general Pericles.

The heart of the Acropolis is the Parthenon, a temple built to thank the gods for the victory over Persian invaders (though it also served as the city treasury for a time). Other prominent buildings include the gateway Propylaea (which serves as the entrance to Acropolis), the Erechtheion Temple (dedicated to Athena and Poseidon), and the tiny but beautiful Temple of Athena Nike.

Many of the buildings in the Acropolis were damaged during the Morean War in 1687. Most of the ancient artifacts found within the temples that survived the damage have been since moved to the Acropolis Museum nearby.</p>

						<p><b>Stonehenge</b>
The prehistoric monument of Stonehenge is one of the most famous landmarks in the UK. Built between 3000 BC and 2000 BC, Stonehenge sits in an area of England known for its many burial mounds.

A massive ring of four-meter-tall sandstones with an inner horseshoe-shaped stone circle, the breathtaking Stonehenge and its surroundings are a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

The purpose of Stonehenge remains a mystery. Archeologists believe it could have been a burial ground dating back to 3000 BC. It could have also served as a Neolithic calendar (as the layout of the stones is set to mark sun movements), a religious place, or a scientific observatory. The stones, which weigh an estimated 25 tons each, were transported at least 19 kilometers to their current location.</p>

						<p><b>View over the Seine River to the Louvre Museum</b>
The world's largest art museum, and the most visited, sits right on the bank of the Seine River. The original 13th-century Louvre Palace that once stood here was expanded and rebuilt over the centuries, resulting in the massive almost 73,000-square-meter building you see today.

Outside, the museum's glass and metal pyramid has become a modern symbol of the Louvre. It measures 34 meters on each side and 21.6 meters tall and is now used as the main entrance to the museum.

Of the Louvre's stunning collection of 380,000 objects, about 35,000 are on permanent display. These include not only paintings but also drawings, sculptures and archaeological items. In addition to Leonardo da Vinci's La Mona Lisa and the Venus of Milo, the museum is also home to the eight-feet-tall Winged Victory of Samothrace sculpture and the magnificent six- by nine-meter Coronation of Napoleon painting.</p>

						<p><b>St Louis Arch</b>
This famous "Gateway to the West" in St. Louis is both symbolic and eye-catching. Rising above the city, gleaming in the midday sun and illuminated at night, the arch can be seen from miles away on the otherwise flat surroundings.

It was built in the early 1960s and stands in Jefferson National Expansion Memorial Park. Elevators offer transportation to the top of the arch where visitors are treated to great views out over the city and surroundings.</p>

						<div class="park"></div>
						<p><b>Glacier National Park</b>
Montana's Glacier National Park offers some of the most beautiful mountain scenery in the United States. Mountains, lakes, glaciers, valleys, and waterfalls combine to form a spectacular alpine landscape. One of the best ways to truly appreciate the terrain is from the famous Going-to-the-Sun Road. This narrow road, hugging the mountain side as it winds its way up and over the 7,747-foot Logan pass, opened in 1932.

Due to the elevation and climate, the road is only open during the summer months. The sights along this road are superlative, and you'll likely find yourself stopping at handy pullouts to soak it all up. Glacier National Park also has some unique historic lodges, including the East Lodge, with it's huge timbered interior. The park is also a top hiking destination in the state; hiking trails leading to wonderful alpine vistas greet those willing to put in a bit of effort.

The park is relatively isolated, so most people plan for a few days for their visit. Accommodation is available in the historic lodges and hotels in West Glacier, and if you feel like camping, 13 campgrounds are available.</p>

						<p><b>San Antonio River Walk</b>
San Antonio's River Walk is a beautiful location and a great place to spend some time, whether you are looking for a place to wander, enjoy a meal, or look for souvenirs. Stretching along the San Antonio River in the heart of the city, this pedestrian area is lined with restaurants and outdoor dining areas, with everything from casual to fine cuisine.

Small boats meander along the river and scenic arching bridges complete the tranquil scene. Large old trees drape over the river and walkway providing shade. The River Walk also features a variety of entertainment, with occasional live music and seasonal events.</p>
